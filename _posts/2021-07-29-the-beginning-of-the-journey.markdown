Welcome to my blog! My goal is to chronicle my journey from software engineer at a large Silicon Valley company to self-employed investor and software developer, including everything I learned along the way. I won't post much and I'll try to keep this blog as high-signal as I can.

A few months ago I decided to quit my well-paid Silicon Valley job, after having spent all of my career as an employee. This is not a tirade by a disgruntled worker bashing their former employer: my experience in Silicon Valley has been mostly very positive and led me to push my boundaries, learn a lot, and develop long-lasting friendships with the smartest people I know. However over the last couple of years I realized that my career goals no longer aligned with those of my employer: I wanted to pursue my own free-form research in fields I found fascinating, and that's hard to do in a corporate environment. So I bowed out and started studying the following:
- Quantum Computing: the intuition-defying features of this deeper, more fundamental computation paradigm set my mind on fire.
- Bitcoin internals: the invention of artificial, absolute digital scarcity and its impact on society was very exciting to me. Plus I have always been interested in the technology Bitcoin was built on (cryptography and distributed systems).
- Investing and Economics: while I have always been and investor, mostly in passive index funds, I cannot say I have more than a superficial knowledge of Economics. However the study of Bitcoin made me much more interested in this field, in particular how a non-inflatable monetary asset could redefine the notion of store of value and how the traditional financial system could be challenged by a digital newcomer that is based on hard mathematical rules and low fees (thanks to the Lightning Network).

I will post on each of these topics in the coming months, and I'll include pointers to materials I have used to study, software I wrote and interesting tidbits I learned. Thanks for reading!
