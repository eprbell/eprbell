Welcome to my blog! My goal is to chronicle my journey from software engineer at a large Silicon Valley company to self-employed investor and software developer, including everything I learned along the way. I won't post much and I'll try to keep this blog as high-signal as I can.

A few months ago I decided to quit my well-paid Silicon Valley job, after having spent all of my (long) career as an employee. This is not a tirade by a disgruntled worker bashing their former employer: my experience in Silicon Valley has been mostly very positive and led me to push my boundaries, learn a lot, and develop long-lasting friendships with the smartest people I know. However over the last couple of years I realized that my career goals no longer aligned with those of my employer: I wanted to pursue my own free-form research in fields I found fascinating, and that's hard to do in a corporate environment. So I bowed out, began my sabbatical and started delving into these topics:
- Quantum Computing: the intuition-defying features of this deeper, more fundamental computation paradigm set my mind on fire. Concepts like entanglment and superposition have no equivalent in our everyday experience, and yet they are the key to unlock powerful performance improvements that are unattainable with classical computers.
- Bitcoin: the invention of artificial, decentralized, digital scarcity is very profound and its potential impact on society could be large (and positive in my opinion). Plus I have always been interested in the technology Bitcoin was built on (cryptography and distributed systems).
- Investing and Economics: while I have always been and investor, mostly in passive index funds, my knowledge of Economics was fairly shallow. However the study of Bitcoin made me want to dig deeper in this field: in particular I wanted to understand how a non-inflatable monetary asset could redefine the notion of store of value and how the traditional financial system could be challenged by a digital newcomer that is based on hard mathematical rules and low-fee, instant, global transfers (thanks to layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network).

I will post on these topics in the coming months, and I'll include pointers to materials I have studied, software I wrote and interesting tidbits I learned. Thanks for reading!
